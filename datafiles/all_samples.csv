You have to summarise the fundamental ideas of the book.
If you have diabetes it is important to maintain a healthy blood glucose level
Symptoms of sciatica can include pain, tingling and numbness in the leg.
To diagnose sciatica, the doctor will take a medical history and examine your spine and legs.
Dementia is a syndrome that is usually chronic and progressive.
Patient confidentiality will be maintained at all times.
Depending on your family history, you may have a genetic predisposition for developing certain disorders.
Diabetes affects the way your body metabolises sugar.
Appendicitis is inflammation of the appendix.
If the appendix bursts, infection is likely to spread, causing serious problems such as an abscess around the appendix.
The surgeon found a lesion on the lung.
Uncomplicated malaria can rapidly progress to severe malaria. Therefore, early diagnosis and treatment of uncomplicated malaria is important.
The bone marrow is unable to make adequate numbers of red cells, normal white cells and platelets. 
Not treating a stroke early can lead to long-term complications
Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition where no insulin is being produced.
Doing regular exercise can prevent chronic health issues, such as cardiovascular disease, from developing.
Heart attacks and strokes are typically acute events that are often caused by a blockage in the blood vessels that supply the heart or brain.
Physical activity can confer many health benefits for adults and older adults, including reduced risk of allcause mortality and cardiovascular disease mortality, prevention of hypertension, site-specific cancers and type 2 diabetes, and improved mental health (reduced symptoms of anxiety and depression), cognitive health and sleep.
In older adults, physical activity helps prevent falls and falls-related injuries and declines in bone health and functional ability.
In addition, for those living with type 2 diabetes, physical activity, including aerobic activity, muscle-strengthening activity, particularly in the elbow, or a combination of both, is associated with improved secondary indicators of risk of disease progression (HbA1c, blood pressure, BMI, and lipids).
Resistance training was associated with greater reduction in HbA1c versus control groups and for high-intensity resistance training on fasting insulin.
Interval training (2–5 times/week; intervals 1–4 mins duration; total session lengths 20–60 mins) was associated with statistically significantly decreased HbA1c by 0.83% compared with no-exercise control groups.
Higher amounts of physical activity (from both below and at, or above the recommended levels of 150 mins/ week of moderate-intensity activity) progressively reduce risk of cardiovascular mortality in adults with type 2 diabetes.
For example, compared with doing no activity, engaging in some activity was associated with a 32% reduction in risk of cardiovascular disease mortality, while engaging in amounts of activity meeting physical activity guidelines or above was associated with a larger 40% reduction in risk of cardiovascular disease mortality.
Most interventions are based around 150–300 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity activity, and/ or 2–3 sessions of resistance training per week.
For some outcomes (e.g. HbA1c and blood pressure) in adults with type 2 diabetes, there is evidence for a stronger effect with more aerobic activity (i.e. greater than 150 mins/ week versus less than 150 mins/week), but limited evidence for intensity.
Appendicitis can be caused by an infection or a blockage in the appendix.
Why this happens is not known, but it may be caused by food or faeces (poo) getting lodged in the appendix.
The appendix becomes blocked, then inflamed, then infected.
Appendicitis can occur at any age, but is most common in children and young adults.
The main way a doctor diagnoses appendicitis is by talking about what has happened, and examining the person with the pain.
It can be hard to diagnose appendicitis, especially in a young child.
Even in adults, it can be hard to tell the difference between appendicitis and conditions like ectopic pregnancies, bowel infections and bowel obstructions.
The doctor may need to examine the person with the pain a number of times.
The doctor may also do scans (an ultrasound or CT scan) and blood tests to help make the diagnosis.
These can help, but don’t give a definite answer.
Sometimes the doctor may recommend an operation to check the appendix even if they are not certain it is inflamed.
Since appendicitis is potentially life threatening if left untreated, doctors will err on the side of caution and operate, even if there is no firm diagnosis.
The main treatment for appendicitis is an operation to remove the inflamed appendix, known as an appendectomy or appendicectomy.
The appendix is not essential for health, and the body functions normally without one.
Although surgery is the main treatment for appendicitis, sometimes antibiotics might be used instead.
They do not work in all cases.
Antibiotics may be used if surgery is delayed, for example, if you have to travel a long way to have the operation, or for patients who are not suitable for surgery such as being too frail.
Your doctor may prescribe antibiotics before surgery to reduce the risk of infection.
There is no proven way to prevent appendicitis.
Early stage (nonproliferative): Blood vessel walls in the retina weaken and bulge, forming tiny pouches (you won’t be able to detect them, but your eye doctor can).
These pouches can leak blood and other fluid, which can cause a part of the retina called the macula to swell (macular edema) and distort your vision.
Macular edema is the most common cause of blindness in people with diabetic retinopathy.
About half of people with diabetic retinopathy will develop macular edema.
Advanced stage (proliferative): In this stage, the retina begins to grow new blood vessels.
These new vessels are fragile and often bleed into the vitreous (the clear gel between the lens and retina).
With minor bleeding, you may see a few dark spots that float in your vision.
If there’s a lot of bleeding, your vision may be completely blocked.
You may not notice symptoms in the early stage.
That’s why it’s very important to get a dilated eye exam at least once a year to catch any problems early when treatment is most effective.
